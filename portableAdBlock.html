									    </header>
									    <p>During the project, we ran into a few issues. The issues included having technical issues with 
											getting the program to run because of the code itself was not working as intended. We fixed 
											this issue by going into the code and editing the DNS records which we provided to allow the 
											code to have bigger list of severs to block. However, this brought up another issue in which that 
											we had conflicting DNS servers that should not have been in the blacklist and thus restricting 
											the ability to use the site correctly. For this issue we went back into the records and found 
											where we thought the address would be and tested the ones, we thought it could be adding 
											them to the whitelist allowing them through. Our main goal for the project was to reduce or if 
											possible, completely take away all Ads on YouTube but we soon found out that it would be 
											nearly impossible because the task is like shooting a moving target because sometimes the 
											target will be hit and block the add before it shows up but other times it doesn’t and allows the 
											Ad to come through. This is a give and take because when trying to block them out entirely you 
											also block out some key things that YouTube does like adding the video to already watched or 
											adding videos to your recommendation tab. </p>

									    </header>
									    <p>For future modification we would like to get a working GUI that is very easy to use. Along those 
											lines we would like to also make a chromium App that functions and does the same thing but not 
											on a network scale more personal browser. The project was successful in its goal of removing all 
											advertainments in applications that were riddled with them. However, it was not successful in 
											our secondary goal of making removing all or most of the Ads on YouTube. Further testing will be 
											required to create an array to expand the DNS list to reduce the Ads even further. Reason for the 
											code not removing the YouTube ads is because the DNS servers that they use for ads is always 
											changing and change very little but enough to not be in the list of DNS to blacklist thus having an 
											array will filter out those discrepancies. This application was only limited to cellphones during our 
											testing but can be expanded to anything with a DNS setting. Thus, not being limited to only 
											cellular devices </p>
